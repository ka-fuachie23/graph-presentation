# Graph

## What is a graph
- It is a collection of **nodes** and **edges**
- Nodes contain data
- Edges are the connecions between nodes
- Nodes are also called vertex

- Graphs are great for describing relationships between things

## Types of graphs
- Directed and undirected
- Cyclic and acyclic
- Weighted graphs

## Graphs and trees

## Terminologies
- Neighbour nodes (Nodes accessible to an edge obeying the direction)

## Representation
- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list

## Traversall algorithms

### Depth first
- Explores nodes as far as possible down a path
- Does not always guarantee the shortest path

### Breadth first
- Explores nodes equally in all directions
- Always guarantees the shortest path

## Algorithm problems
