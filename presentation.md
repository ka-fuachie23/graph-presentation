- Graphs are great for describing relationships between things

## Types of graphs
- Directed and undirected
- Cyclic and acyclic
- Weighted graphs

## Graphs and trees

## Terminologies
- Neighbour nodes (Nodes accessible to an edge obeying the direction)

## Representation
- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list

## Traversall algorithms

### Depth first

### Breadth first
